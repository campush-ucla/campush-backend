AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers.\n\nThe mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.\n\nAIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth.\n\nIn 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves.\n\nToday AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Other Categories":"Engineering, Academic","Phone Number":"(949) 294-2930","Email":"uclaaiche@gmail.com","Website":"aiche.seas.ucla.edu","Signatory 1":"Corinna Lee","Signatory 2":"Mark  Keller","Signatory 3":"Brandan Taing","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests, and who meet the minimum qualifications. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).\n\nPsi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.\n\nWhat are the Goals of Psi Chi?\n\nPsi Chi serves two major goals–one immediate and visibly rewarding to the individual member, the other slower and more difficult to accomplish, but offering greater rewards in the long run. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.","Other Categories":"Honor Societies, Academic","Phone Number":"626-607-8787","Email":"uclapsichi@gmail.com","Website":"https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Ouxun Jiang","Signatory 2":"Emily Berrios","Signatory 3":"Samantha Fisher","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way.\n\nWEEKLY MEETING\nMeetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399. During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. \nWe often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. \n\nMEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL\nMeditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations.\n\nBOOKCLUBS\nYou can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.\n\nOTHER PROGRAMS\nWe encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more.\n\nFacebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA","Other Categories":"Academic, Journals","Phone Number":"(310) 694-2698","Email":"bruin.philosophical.society@gmail.com","Website":"http://philosophy.ucla.edu/undergraduate/philosophy-club/","Signatory 1":"Shan  Vartanian","Signatory 2":"Sophia McMurry","Signatory 3":"Nico Vastagh","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued.\nOne of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances.\nIn 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled \"Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education.\" In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.","Other Categories":"Academic, African American","Phone Number":"949-600-3523","Email":"nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Tierney Sharpe Dioffo","Signatory 2":"Zalondria Graham","Signatory 3":"Jaz Buckley","Advisor Name":"KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body.\n\nToday, Student Stroke Team operates 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and continues to serve their campus and local community with their dedicated team of members. SST members are research associates of Dr. Sidney Starkman for the UCLA Stroke Network and work alongside neurologists during code strokes in the Emergency Room of the UCLA Medical Center. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. In this way, undergraduates are introduced to vascular neurology, emergency medicine, and clinical research.\n\nStudents in the Student Stroke Team are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure. Altogether, students in this program play a significant role in the identification of candidates for stroke clinical trials while being exposed to stroke neurology, emergency medicine, unparalleled patient interaction and a tremendous knowledge of ongoing clinical trials.","Other Categories":"Medical, Academic","Phone Number":"(323) 208-9134","Email":"stroke@ucla.edu","Website":"https://www.strokeprogram.org/","Signatory 1":"Michael Kim","Signatory 2":"Kyle Sheu","Signatory 3":"Erica Nagase","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups.  By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches:\n\nUGSP Brown Bag Committee\nThis committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department.\n\nUGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee \nThis committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school.\n\nUGSP High School Outreach Committee \nAs members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service.  UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college.\n\nUGSP Social Committee \nThe Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus. Our goal in organizing these events is to foster a sense of community among UGSP members. It is a chance for students to interact with people that come from diverse backgrounds who share similar experiences.","Other Categories":"Academic, Cultural/Ethnic","Phone Number":"(516)998-8215","Email":"ucla.ugsp@gmail.com","Website":"https://ugsp.psych.ucla.edu/","Signatory 1":"ReJoyce Green","Signatory 2":"Gerald Higginbotham","Signatory 3":"Blanche Wright","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field. \n","Other Categories":"Service - Outreach, Academic","Phone Number":"(818) 941-6830","Email":"CCFBioAlliance@gmail.com","Website":"https://communitycollegefieldbiologyalliance.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Amanda  Robin ","Signatory 2":"Aneri Patel","Signatory 3":"Cynthia  Frausto","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

By working under the umbrella of our own organization, we strive to streamline our internal processes, maximize our impact on the UCLA community and reinforce the university’s position as a global center for Armenian studies.\n","Other Categories":"Academic, Educational","Phone Number":"(310) 825-4165","Email":"agsc@ucla.edu","Website":"https://nelc.ucla.edu/conference/agsc/","Signatory 1":"Anatolii Tokmantcev","Signatory 2":"Anahit Pogossian","Signatory 3":"Peter Cowe","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

Through these group discussions, students can find, connect, and support each other not just through an interdisciplinary lens, but one which attempts to center their voices and perspectives outside of a classic western canon. As we learn about these things, students can talk about their experiences as students and as artists who hope to make change. \n\nSecond, students will work collaboratively to organise and put on bi-annual events. As students learn and expand upon different ideas and theories, we hope to expand the discussion beyond the group through a panel symposium centered around related themes. The panel would consist of both students and invited guest lecturers of varying fields and practices to present and engage with attendees.

Heritage students may include individuals who study or research a community with which they share cultural and/or ethnic roots, including but not limited to: indigenous peoples, native peoples, people of color, and biracial or multiracial individuals. \n\nOur focus is connecting interdisciplinary projects and people to foster collaboration and healthy academic networking. Heritage students face challenges not only on campus, where they tend to be underrepresented, but also in the field. Balancing the roles of researcher and heritage students can be a difficult endeavor, and by creating a support system, we hope to combat these challenges and make heritage research purposeful, ethical, and empowering. Heritage students play a special role in research by connecting their cultural community with the academic community. The group is intended to be both social (where students with similar interests, general backgrounds, and research can interact) and professional (where students can discuss academic endeavors, pursuits, and goals). \n\nIn a time where student diversity is often co-opted by institutions seeking to diversity their departmental statistics, we seek to refocus heritage students back onto their goals, their communities, and the motivations that keep them working on these unique and personal projects.\n\nOur first large goal is to create one workshop per year open to the campus to connect scholars across different departments and programs at UCLA. A potential topic of the workshop will focus on community engagement: how does research across departments actively involve local communities in research, on both the macro and micro scales? What is our role as a researcher in underrepresented communities? How does research translate from the local community to the academic community? The purpose of this workshop is to share methodologies and engage in decolonial discourses.\n","Other Categories":"Cultural, Academic","Phone Number":"(657)845-9755","Email":"myakal@ucla.edu","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Madeleine Yakal","Signatory 2":"Danielle Heinz","Signatory 3":"Stephen Acabado","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Academic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Academic"}

The organisation's purpose comes in two parts. \n\nOne, students from all disciplines and fields are encouraged to come for bi-weekly meetings to discuss and explore readings, movies, political and social frameworks, and other materials which support historically and presently marginalised communities, movements, and histories. Through these group discussions, students can find, connect, and support each other not just through an interdisciplinary lens, but one which attempts to center their voices and perspectives outside of a classic western canon. As we learn about these things, students can talk about their experiences as students and as artists who hope to make change. \n\nSecond, students will work collaboratively to organise and put on bi-annual events. As students learn and expand upon different ideas and theories, we hope to expand the discussion beyond the group through a panel symposium centered around related themes. The panel would consist of both students and invited guest lecturers of varying fields and practices to present and engage with attendees. The purpose of this symposium would be to allow students a public platform to engage with their own interests and work collaboratively with their contemporaries (working artists, poets, writers, e.t.c). \n","Other Categories":"Arts, Academic","Phone Number":"(310)699-7903","Email":"acho16@g.ucla.edu","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Hirsch  Perlman","Signatory 2":"Sue-Yeon Cho","Signatory 3":"Maya Tripathi","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Arts","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Arts"}

The V-Day Coalition brought \"The Vagina Monologues\" to UCLA for four years, but has turned to producing and creating \"Lips.\"\nLIPS is a student written, produced and performed play. This play is a response to Vagina Monologues; V-Day has historically performed V-Day with a disclaimer that Vagina Monologues leaves out important narratives, but its mission as a whole is good. After deciding that a disclaimer is no longer enough, we decided to address the issues presented by Vagina Monologues. This is a play by UCLA students, for UCLA students, filled with important rhetoric and stories that focuses on being more inclusive and based in intersectional feminist ideology.","Other Categories":"Arts, Social Activism","Phone Number":"(510) 463-7194","Email":"vdaycoalitionucla@gmail.com","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Erin Earp","Signatory 2":"Zainab Khan","Signatory 3":"Yafei (Daisy) Zheng","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Arts","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Arts"}

That inaugural program gave rise to Famigo, the first of many 3DS companies to raise venture capital and release a successful product.\nThe student organization incorporated as a nonprofit in 2010 and began expansion to universities across the globe. While early programs focused on strictly technology- and web-enabled startups, demand has led the team to expand the program to function across broader entrepreneurial endeavors. Schools have hosted 3DS programs focused on themes such as social innovation, energy, culinary, hardware, and more.\nForegoing a grant-supported model, the founders developed an earned-revenues strategy—3DS charges universities, governments, and corporations to deliver programs—which allowed the organization to grow in a scalable and sustainable way while preserving mission autonomy. Running 3DS as a successful business operation keeps entrepreneurship in the organizational DNA and allows the organization to remain faithful to the philosophy of learning-by-doing.","Other Categories":"Business, Leadership","Phone Number":"(424)386-6465","Email":"3daystartupucla@gmail.com","Website":"http://ucla.3daystartup.org","Signatory 1":"Saite Yuan","Signatory 2":"Lecheng Shi","Signatory 3":"Crystal Li","Advisor Name":"JAKE Gildea","Original Category":"Business","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Business"}

None, however, have to accomplish all of this in 2 years! Furthermore, we believe the relative lack of visibility of transfers has discouraged many from participating fully in campus life. Therefore, we've created this network for transfers who are interested in pursuing careers in business to bridge the gap between academic life at UCLA and the professional world outside of campus.

MEChA was founded on the principles of self-determination for the liberation of our people. We believe that political involvement and education is the avenue for change in our society. \nThe organization grew during the Civil Rights and Chicano Movement in the 1960s, and the group coalesced out of several organizations formed during that turbulent decade and came together at a conference in Denver. One of the founding documents that was created in the conference was \"El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán,\" which reflects the sentiment of the Latino/Chicano youth during an era of a turbulent social climate. In 1968, the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), Sal Castro, and other youth organized the East L.A. walkouts, called the Blowouts, a series of protests against unfair conditions in Los Angeles schools. Following the blowouts in March of 1969, students, teachers and community activists gathered at the University of California, Santa Barbara and drafted “El Plan de Santa Barbara,” which has now become important history and documented what has guided our organization to better serve our community. \nThrough these documents, our organization is dedicated to the empowerment of raza students by working towards self-determination in our communities. Students develop a sense of identity, leadership and community. As an organization, we recognize our role as the official voice of all raza students on campus, and, taking this into account, our purpose is to advocate on behalf of raza students needs as well as offer our support. MEChA’s goal is to create a unity amongst students on campus and to make sure they are aware that they have a familia away from home without forgetting how community conditions have historically affected us. We aim to increase retention through our Calmecac mentoring program, increase educational access through Xinachtli, and raise consciousness of community issues with our Raza Youth Empowerment Program.","Other Categories":"Political, Cultural","Phone Number":"(323) 427-7926","Email":"mechadeucla@gmail.com","Website":"mechadeucla.com","Signatory 1":"Vivyana Prado","Signatory 2":"Eduardo Velasquez","Signatory 3":"Brian Luna","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Cultural","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Cultural"}

Heritage students may include individuals who study or research a community with which they share cultural and/or ethnic roots, including but not limited to: indigenous peoples, native peoples, people of color, and biracial or multiracial individuals. \n\nOur focus is connecting interdisciplinary projects and people to foster collaboration and healthy academic networking. Heritage students face challenges not only on campus, where they tend to be underrepresented, but also in the field. Balancing the roles of researcher and heritage students can be a difficult endeavor, and by creating a support system, we hope to combat these challenges and make heritage research purposeful, ethical, and empowering. Heritage students play a special role in research by connecting their cultural community with the academic community. The group is intended to be both social (where students with similar interests, general backgrounds, and research can interact) and professional (where students can discuss academic endeavors, pursuits, and goals). \n\nIn a time where student diversity is often co-opted by institutions seeking to diversity their departmental statistics, we seek to refocus heritage students back onto their goals, their communities, and the motivations that keep them working on these unique and personal projects.\n\nOur first large goal is to create one workshop per year open to the campus to connect scholars across different departments and programs at UCLA. A potential topic of the workshop will focus on community engagement: how does research across departments actively involve local communities in research, on both the macro and micro scales? What is our role as a researcher in underrepresented communities? How does research translate from the local community to the academic community? The purpose of this workshop is to share methodologies and engage in decolonial discourses.\n","Other Categories":"Cultural, Academic","Phone Number":"(657)845-9755","Email":"myakal@ucla.edu","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Madeleine Yakal","Signatory 2":"Danielle Heinz","Signatory 3":"Stephen Acabado","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Cultural","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Cultural"}

DM seeks to empower the UCLA campus community in the fight against pediatric AIDS, raising funds and awareness about the importance of HIV education and testing, while helping young people make a difference in halting the spread of this devastating pandemic. \n\nNow entering its 18th year, DM has grown to be the largest student-run philanthropic event that raises funds and awareness for HIV/AIDS. However, DM is only a part of our larger, umbrella organization: the Pediatric AIDS Coalition (PAC). Now, not only will the students involved with PAC put on and participate in DM, but they will also participate in other events in an attempt to involve more of the community; people that may be inclined to fight for the cause but may not necessarily be interested in a DM.\n\nDance Marathon has raised over $5.5 million in the past 16 years, benefiting HIV-positive children around the world. Proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, “the largest Pediatric AIDS foundation in the United States“, the Laurel Foundation which is a free summer camp program that provide HIV-affected children with the experience of a lifetime, and the UCLA AIDS Institute, a cutting-edge research facility at the forefront of the search for a cure. Dance Marathon 2019 will be in the historic PAULEY PAVILION in April 2019!\n\nPAC also sponsors activities on campus throughout the year for the UCLA community including AIDS education in the form of performances and presentations, mentor days with kids from the camps, free HIV testing, and coordination of major events for World AIDS Day at UCLA. New programs include the Life Skills Retreat and a Family Mentorship Program. PAC is constantly looking for new, innovative ways to unite students, community activists, celebrities and leaders around the cause of pediatric AIDS treatment and eradication, and PAC is looking forward to its expansion into the greater Los Angeles community.\n\nDM has become a poster in the UCLA community, so much so that people commonly say that you can't graduate UCLA without having done DM at least once. People say that our generation is not empathetic, but DM proves them wrong.

We know that there is a lot of research out there on health issues that are currently plaguing college students, but we want to cater out research and solutions specifically for the UCLA student body. Being a college student requires juggling academics, extra-curricular activities, work, friends, and family among a myriad of other things. Sometimes the health of the student gets pushed in the backseat in order to deal with these tasks, and students become sleep-deprived, consume energy drinks, abuse academic performance enhancement drug, and much, much more. Our goal is to find research studies and conduct our own research about healthy living styles and healthy alternatives to common choices and to disseminate this research to the UCLA student body so we can arm them with the tools they need to make the decisions that are best for them not only now, but also for the future.","Other Categories":"Health and Wellness, Educational","Phone Number":"310-825-7586","Email":"swc.search@gmail.com","Website":"https://swc.ucla.edu/","Signatory 1":"Odilia Lu","Signatory 2":"Tara \t Shooshani","Signatory 3":"Charlotte Chan","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Educational","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Educational"}

The students will take a diagnostic at the beginning and end of the year to monitor growth in specific concepts for each student and the group as a whole. Based upon these tests the curriculum for the program will be organized around the concepts of greatest struggle as highlighted by the diagnostic. \nThe first approach that LEAD will take will attempt to counter the present learning style in a typical math classroom, as it will encourage asking questions, working in groups, and a growth mindset. The program will attempt to execute the following three elements: basic skills, conceptual understanding and problem solving. LEAD will use real life application relevant to the students and by motivating students to work together and to think out loud, we hope to build leadership skills and development.\nThe second approach includes having activities and discussions that allow students to examine the intersections of race, class and math to get a greater understanding of the disparity of African American students in high level math classes and to combat the stigma of inadequacy.","Other Categories":"Educational, Community Service","Phone Number":"(424) 313-4860","Email":"lead@ucla.edu","Website":"https://leaducla.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Kailash Ram","Signatory 2":"Smriti Sanchita","Signatory 3":"Eshan Uniyal","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Educational","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Educational"}

AIChE was established in 1908 with the purpose of establishing chemical engineers as a profession independent from chemists and mechanical engineers.\n\nThe mission of the AIChE student chapter at UCLA is to promote excellence in the Chemical Engineering Department of the School of Engineering and Applied Science by providing resources and support to the undergraduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.\n\nAIChE's vision is to provide value as the global leader of the chemical engineering profession and be the lifetime center for professional and personal growth.\n\nIn 1908 a small group of chemical engineers formed a professional society to promote and improve chemical engineering as a discipline. At first, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) met with strong resistance, especially from the American Chemical Society (ACS), which claimed control over all pure and applied chemistry in the United States. In response, AIChE adopted a number of conservative measures, including strict membership criteria to keep membership low and avoid competition with ACS. Nonetheless, the value of AIChE was realized by the entire discipline in 1925, when chemical engineering became the first profession to use scholastic accreditation to ensure the consistency and quality of academic chemical engineering courses. The conservative attitude paid off when peace was made between ACS and AIChE around 1930. The membership criteria were lifted and chemical engineers joined in droves.\n\nToday AIChE remains the principal chemical engineering professional society in the United States. Currently about 57,000 (~70%) of American chemical engineers are members.","Other Categories":"Engineering, Academic","Phone Number":"(949) 294-2930","Email":"uclaaiche@gmail.com","Website":"aiche.seas.ucla.edu","Signatory 1":"Corinna Lee","Signatory 2":"Mark  Keller","Signatory 3":"Brandan Taing","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Engineering","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Engineering"}

Specifically, our team of UCLA students designs, manufactures, and tests custom drones for accomplishing a series of mission objectives, as outlined by the AUVSI SUAS competition rules for the current season. This competition is held annually at the end of the school year in Maryland, where over 60 teams (half of which are international) compete for the best mission performance, technical design paper, and flight readiness presentation.\nUAS@UCLA complements the undergraduate engineering education at UCLA by offering the chance to gain hands-on experience on a complex engineering project. This project requires members to not only think outside the box of their major, but also learn collaboration and management skills through experience. Ultimately, UAS@UCLA is a big commitment, but the skills that are taught on the team directly apply to the professional environments you will experience in later jobs and internships.\nAs of 2018, UAS@UCLA has competed twice in the AUVSI competition, producing the two drones seen in the videos above. Our most recent drone, Spinny, is a 5ft diameter industrial-grade drone capable of 100lbs maximum lift and close to an hour of flight time at its base configuration. The current plan for this upcoming season is to use the existing flight vehicle hardware to mature the software framework running on board and on the ground to maximize mission performance and reliability of the platform. In addition, our team will begin the design process for our next drone -- a plane designed to build upon the legacy of Spinny and provide a new set of challenges for our team to address. Although the plane may turn into a two-year development, there will be lots of engineering questions to be answered by new members to ensure the success of this platform.\nFinally, UAS@UCLA is a family, and the connections you make on the team can not only serve to further your professional career, but also give you support during and beyond your time in the undergraduate programs offered at UCLA. One of the main goals of our 2018 - 2019 leadership team is to grow our club's culture and attract not only the best engineers to join our program, but also develop a diversified team with extensive collaboration opportunities among other teams at UCLA and internal career resources for leading members into their dream internship/job position in the STEM fields.","Other Categories":"Engineering, Technology","Phone Number":"(760)681-6528","Email":"unmannedsystems.ucla@gmail.com","Website":"uasatucla.org","Signatory 1":"David Thorne","Signatory 2":"Comran Morshed","Signatory 3":"Armaan Singh","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Engineering","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Engineering"}

It draws its name from the Ki-Swahili term Nommo, which means the magical power of the word. First printed in 1968, NOMMO joined Student Media in 1969 to become the first ethnic student run publication on a college campus in the United States.\n\nIn today’s often confusing and certainly tumultuous societal environment the most obvious fundamental ingredient toward reason, understanding, and progress is improved communication of thoughts and realities. In that sense, NOMMO is multipurpose and multifunctional. It fills a deep gap: it helps Black students identify and clarify a vast array of attitudes and goals, and it is an invaluable step toward wider communication between Black students and the campus community and the community-at-large. The world that the news media offers to their Black audiences is almost totally white in both appearance and attitude, save for the moments where Black death enters as a spectacle. In response, NOMMO seeks to give currency to the expression of Black power for Black people through the power of the written word.\n\nIn 1963 James Baldwin aptly noted, “The future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country.” NOMMO prioritizes the Black community in order to shine light on the issues that reverberate throughout society. It is a beacon that seeks to find and report the truth.","Other Categories":"Media, Ethnic","Phone Number":"(310)825-9898","Email":"nommo@media.ucla.edu","Website":"https://nommomagazine.com/","Signatory 1":"Asia Dessert","Signatory 2":"Mahala Herron-Rutland","Signatory 3":"Bianca Onyekwere","Advisor Name":"MELISSA Veluz-Abraham","Original Category":"Ethnic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Ethnic"}

The sorority supports and provides a safe space for people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and diverse backgrounds. It emphasizes emotional support, personal development,\nunconditional acceptance.\n\nFounded in Spring of 2009, Gamma Rho Lambda has expanded into the first LGBT sorority on campus. In Spring 2010 GRL officially affiliated with UCLA's Multi-Interest Greek Council and became Zeta Chapter.\n\nSome examples of Gamma Rho Lambda's events are: game night, home-cooked dinners, Women's Day, socials, sister dates, as well as an end of the year banquet. We've volunteered at AIDS Walk and Vote for Equality and marched at LA pride and Long Beach Pride. We've fundraised by selling bracelets, rainbow cupcakes, and other baked goods.\n\nGamma Rho Lambda is much smaller than most typical sororities, but we pride ourselves in this fact. Our intimate size allows us to get to know every member and grow together as a community. Our biggest priority is to create a second home for our members, so that every member feels they have a family at UCLA. We provide an opportunity for growth and diversity. In addition, Gamma Rho Lambda aims to provide a safe, accepting, and supportive space for queer members who may not be out to their families.\n\nOn a national level, Gamma Rho Lambda currently has 14 chapters across the country and 1 colony. Our chapters are at Arizona State University, San Diego State University, CSU Northridge, UCLA, Purdue, SUNY- Albany, Northern Arizona University, University of Houston, UC Berkley, and UC Riverside, Ball State,Tulane, Iowa State, and American University. We also have a colony at University of Iowa. Each year we have a summer convention where representatives from all the chapters and colonies come and meet their fellow siblings. This weekend is not only a bonding experience, but an experience to share what every chapter has accomplished while spreading both ideas and concerns to each other and our National Council.\n\nPlease feel free to email us at zeta@gammarholambda.org if you have any questions or visit our website at grlzeta.wordpress.com to see what upcoming Rush or Sorority events we have planned!","Other Categories":"Greek Life - Sororities, Social Activism","Phone Number":"(707) 951-5070","Email":"zeta@gammarholambda.org","Website":"http://www.gammarholambda.org/zeta","Signatory 1":"Emily Earnest","Signatory 2":"Wren Crapser","Signatory 3":"Dana Dixon","Advisor Name":"LAWRENCE Daves","Original Category":"Greek Life - Sororities","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Greek%20Life%20-%20Sororities"}

Membership is open to graduate and undergraduate men and women who are making the study of psychology one of their major interests, and who meet the minimum qualifications. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).\n\nPsi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at over 1,000 senior colleges and universities in the USA and Canada. The Central Office is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A Board of Directors, composed of psychologists who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides the affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.\n\nWhat are the Goals of Psi Chi?\n\nPsi Chi serves two major goals–one immediate and visibly rewarding to the individual member, the other slower and more difficult to accomplish, but offering greater rewards in the long run. The first of these is the Society’s obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership. The second goal is the obligation of each of the Society’s local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter. In addition, the international organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including Society and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs.","Other Categories":"Honor Societies, Academic","Phone Number":"626-607-8787","Email":"uclapsichi@gmail.com","Website":"https://uclapsichi.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Ouxun Jiang","Signatory 2":"Emily Berrios","Signatory 3":"Samantha Fisher","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Honor Societies","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Honor%20Societies"}

We encourage authors to submit original work that encompasses topics concerned with any aspect of German language (either historical or applied linguistics), German intellectual history and philosophy, as well as German cultural studies (art, film, literature, and theater) from the Middle Ages to the present.\nBook reviews, interviews, and translations also make up an important component of the journal.","Other Categories":"Journals, Academic","Phone Number":"310-206-0744","Email":"ngr.humnet@ucla.edu","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Anna Brungardt","Signatory 2":"Andreas Benjamin Seyfert","Signatory 3":"Anna Bonazzi","Advisor Name":"KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo","Original Category":"Journals","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Journals"}

This is a place where you can grapple with philosophical questions, and we can mutually work together to try to better our understanding of the world, our behavior within it, and whether or not we are justified in our beliefs. Whether you have only a budding interest in philosophy or if you are well versed in philosophical discourse, the club is a great way to expand your knowledge of the field and make friends along the way.\n\nWEEKLY MEETING\nMeetings are held every Tuesday at 6 pm in Dodd 399. During meetings, we discuss a specific philosophical issue for about an hour and a half. Topics are chosen and presented by any club members and often explore topics not commonly covered in undergraduate courses, e.g.: philosophy of progress, experience machine, and animal rights. We encourage you to present your own ideas! Sometimes we host philosophy-themed movie nights instead. \nWe often go to Westwood for dinner after our weekly meetings to continue the discussion. \n\nMEDITATIONS PHILOSOPHY JOURNAL\nMeditations is the undergraduate journal of philosophy at UCLA. The purpose of the journal is to foster philosophical thought and provide an opportunity for undergraduates to gain writing and publishing experience. Maybe you have a philosophy paper that you’re really proud of, or you’re looking for a platform to test your arguments and be challenged. Maybe you have some cool ideas but hate writing when a grade depends on it. We encourage undergraduates of any major to participate in Meditations.\n\nBOOKCLUBS\nYou can also be a part of our book club. The book club offers a chance to do a close reading of philosophical texts. During our weekly discussions, we will try to understand the ideas presented in the readings by breaking down nuances such as rhetoric and symbolism.\n\nOTHER PROGRAMS\nWe encourage members to attend events organized by the Philosophy Department. We also cooperate with the department to plan events for you. For example coffee time with professors, study lounge, and information panel, and more.\n\nFacebook: Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA","Other Categories":"Academic, Journals","Phone Number":"(310) 694-2698","Email":"bruin.philosophical.society@gmail.com","Website":"http://philosophy.ucla.edu/undergraduate/philosophy-club/","Signatory 1":"Shan  Vartanian","Signatory 2":"Sophia McMurry","Signatory 3":"Nico Vastagh","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Journals","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Journals"}

We recognize that this objective may seem formidable, ambitious even. After all, it is difficult to represent such a disparate array of clubs, teams and organizations. However, rather than bemoan such a daunting task, we are instead committed to embracing this immense diversity; which paints our campus in different strokes and which allows us both to appreciate the uniqueness within ourselves as well as in others.\n\nMoreover, we do not see UCLA as an isolated outpost in the greater Los Angeles area, disconnected and aloof from its surrounding environment. Instead, we see the two entities as active partners in a fruitful relationship that is continuing to evolve in significant and important ways. Thus, not only do we hope to advocate student engagement on campus, but we also hope to extend that engagement to the community of Los Angeles. As citizens and students of this active, moving city, we must recognize our own interdependence, our own parallel currents; we must become more conscious of the direction in which we are moving; and the Office of the Internal Vice President is committed to doing this.","Other Categories":"Student Government - USAC Affiliated, Leadership","Phone Number":"714-381-0104","Email":"usaivp@gmail.com","Website":"http://www.usac.ucla.edu","Signatory 1":"Kimberly  Bonifacio","Signatory 2":"Justin Suarez","Signatory 3":"Sarah Erckenbrack","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Cohn","Original Category":"Leadership","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Leadership"}

We hope to establish disciples of Christ by laying a foundation of devotion to Christ and building Christlike character. Devotion to Christ as expressed by an enjoyment of the Word of God, a zeal for prayer, and a love for the family of Christ are essentials to establish in a disciple’s life. These are necessary for transforming a disciple’s character to be more Christlike.\nEquip: God commands us all to go and make disciples! We equip brothers and sisters to make new disciples themselves by teaching them how to share the Gospel and how to establish and encourage others in the faith.

That inaugural program gave rise to Famigo, the first of many 3DS companies to raise venture capital and release a successful product.\nThe student organization incorporated as a nonprofit in 2010 and began expansion to universities across the globe. While early programs focused on strictly technology- and web-enabled startups, demand has led the team to expand the program to function across broader entrepreneurial endeavors. Schools have hosted 3DS programs focused on themes such as social innovation, energy, culinary, hardware, and more.\nForegoing a grant-supported model, the founders developed an earned-revenues strategy—3DS charges universities, governments, and corporations to deliver programs—which allowed the organization to grow in a scalable and sustainable way while preserving mission autonomy. Running 3DS as a successful business operation keeps entrepreneurship in the organizational DNA and allows the organization to remain faithful to the philosophy of learning-by-doing.","Other Categories":"Business, Leadership","Phone Number":"(424)386-6465","Email":"3daystartupucla@gmail.com","Website":"http://ucla.3daystartup.org","Signatory 1":"Saite Yuan","Signatory 2":"Lecheng Shi","Signatory 3":"Crystal Li","Advisor Name":"JAKE Gildea","Original Category":"Leadership","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Leadership"}

It draws its name from the Ki-Swahili term Nommo, which means the magical power of the word. First printed in 1968, NOMMO joined Student Media in 1969 to become the first ethnic student run publication on a college campus in the United States.\n\nIn today’s often confusing and certainly tumultuous societal environment the most obvious fundamental ingredient toward reason, understanding, and progress is improved communication of thoughts and realities. In that sense, NOMMO is multipurpose and multifunctional. It fills a deep gap: it helps Black students identify and clarify a vast array of attitudes and goals, and it is an invaluable step toward wider communication between Black students and the campus community and the community-at-large. The world that the news media offers to their Black audiences is almost totally white in both appearance and attitude, save for the moments where Black death enters as a spectacle. In response, NOMMO seeks to give currency to the expression of Black power for Black people through the power of the written word.\n\nIn 1963 James Baldwin aptly noted, “The future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country.” NOMMO prioritizes the Black community in order to shine light on the issues that reverberate throughout society. It is a beacon that seeks to find and report the truth.","Other Categories":"Media, Ethnic","Phone Number":"(310)825-9898","Email":"nommo@media.ucla.edu","Website":"https://nommomagazine.com/","Signatory 1":"Asia Dessert","Signatory 2":"Mahala Herron-Rutland","Signatory 3":"Bianca Onyekwere","Advisor Name":"MELISSA Veluz-Abraham","Original Category":"Media","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Media"}

One foot at a time.\n\nWithout homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day. Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience.\n\nAt shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance.\n\nFor many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again.\n\nThe power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling.

Since its humble beginnings, the UCLA Stroke Program has split into two separate sister organizations: Student Stroke Team and Stroke Force. Both programs have expanded into well-ordered and effective student-operated organizations, each consisting of roughly 25 students rigorously chosen from UCLA's student body.\n\nToday, Student Stroke Team operates 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and continues to serve their campus and local community with their dedicated team of members. SST members are research associates of Dr. Sidney Starkman for the UCLA Stroke Network and work alongside neurologists during code strokes in the Emergency Room of the UCLA Medical Center. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. In this way, undergraduates are introduced to vascular neurology, emergency medicine, and clinical research.\n\nStudents in the Student Stroke Team are involved in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter research projects investigating the efficacy of various drugs and procedures applied to the patients that arrive in the UCLA Emergency Room with onset of acute ischemic stroke. As research associates, students learn the basis for the investigation of new drugs and interventions in stroke, the pre-clinical research, the phases of trials, and the proper interpretation of the results obtained. In their tasks, students utilize their knowledge of the study hypothesis and methodology, patient selection criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rationale for the use of the drug procedure. Altogether, students in this program play a significant role in the identification of candidates for stroke clinical trials while being exposed to stroke neurology, emergency medicine, unparalleled patient interaction and a tremendous knowledge of ongoing clinical trials.","Other Categories":"Medical, Academic","Phone Number":"(323) 208-9134","Email":"stroke@ucla.edu","Website":"https://www.strokeprogram.org/","Signatory 1":"Michael Kim","Signatory 2":"Kyle Sheu","Signatory 3":"Erica Nagase","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Medical","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Medical"}

Since its founding in 2007, Afya has delivered over 26 billion dollars in supplies to 35 different countries. When first establishing a relationship with a new hospital or clinic, we ask that they create a \"wish-list\" of their most needed supplies and equipment. This ranges from items such as surgical masks and pens to larger medical equipment, including operating tables and ultrasound machines. Upon assessing the needs of each facility, Afya works with US hospitals, corporations, and individuals to gather the supplies and ship them via sea cargo containers to these partners abroad. While our immediate goal is to improve the quality and availability of healthcare in undeserved areas, we also reduce the environmental impact in our own country by diverting \"waste\" from landfills and incineration to people in dire need. \n\nAfya at UCLA is an entirely student-run extension of this foundation. In our first year as a brand new group to UCLA in Fall 2014, our aim was to establish a presence on campus as well as throughout the Los Angeles area. Afya is in the throws of establishing a satellite warehouse in LA for hospital donations, and we hope to strengthen this network through reaching out to hospitals, nursing homes, and private medical practices.

To do so, we conduct interviews across Southern California with the children and their families to highlight holistic aspects of their lives. In our discussion with the patients, we also wish to understand structural barriers in society that exacerbate their surgical conditions, such as insurance issues, bullying, housing insecurity, etc. Moreover, we hope to eradicate these issues through connecting them with the right resources and organizations, using the funds that we raise to do so. \n\nIn addition to working towards patient care on an individual basis, we increase awareness about socioeconomic and sociocultural disparities in the healthcare system. With our written pieces about legal reform, anecdotal instances of inequity, and research-based findings about healthcare, we call attention to an area that is often overlooked—the surgical and psychological health of marginalized children within domestic borders.

This disease has devastating impacts on patients and their families, and thus, efforts should be taken to decrease its incidence among the population. A significant number of cancer cases can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle, as environmental factors play an influential role in mutating genes and activating cancerous cells. Considering the current concerns regarding this disease, our organization aims to increase awareness about different cancers and their prevention methods. By doing so, we hope to ultimately decrease the number of new cancer cases each year.\n1- Since drug and alcohol abuse, and obesity are linked to cancer, CPP conducts information sessions, activities and events to promote a healthy lifestyle—both at UCLA and at local highschools.\n2- As a prevention method for skin cancer, sun-safety sessions shall be conducted to emphasize the importance of sunscreen.\n3- General meetings shall host panels with physicians to increase cancer awareness.\n4- Cancer-related careers shall be discussed in general meetings, in multiple fields.\n5- General meetings can host cancer researchers to inform club members about the recent advances in cancer treatment and prevention\n6- Fundraiser events shall be organized to raise money for cancer research and treatment, collaborating with well-known charities.\n7- Most importantly, CPP aims to increase awareness about Human \nPapillomavirus (HPV) not only in the UCLA community but also in the greater Los Angeles area. \nThe Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a great concern of the medical society as it can develop into various health problems such as genital warts and different cancers. In fact, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among the general population. Fortunately, there are methods to prevent HPV such as becoming vaccinated, being screened, and practicing safer sexual relationships. Despite being a vulnerable target for HPV—the most common sexually transmitted infection—a significant number of college students are unaware of this disease and its prevention methods. We hope that by explaining the complications associated with HPV we can increase the rate of vaccination in our community and thus, decrease the prevalence of cervical cancer.","Other Categories":"Service - Community Involvement, Medical","Phone Number":"310-488-8260","Email":"uclacpp@gmail.com","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Golbarg  Rahimi","Signatory 2":"Rana Yakhshi Tafti","Signatory 3":"Mahdi Rafati","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Medical","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Medical"}

MEChA was founded on the principles of self-determination for the liberation of our people. We believe that political involvement and education is the avenue for change in our society. \nThe organization grew during the Civil Rights and Chicano Movement in the 1960s, and the group coalesced out of several organizations formed during that turbulent decade and came together at a conference in Denver. One of the founding documents that was created in the conference was \"El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán,\" which reflects the sentiment of the Latino/Chicano youth during an era of a turbulent social climate. In 1968, the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), Sal Castro, and other youth organized the East L.A. walkouts, called the Blowouts, a series of protests against unfair conditions in Los Angeles schools. Following the blowouts in March of 1969, students, teachers and community activists gathered at the University of California, Santa Barbara and drafted “El Plan de Santa Barbara,” which has now become important history and documented what has guided our organization to better serve our community. \nThrough these documents, our organization is dedicated to the empowerment of raza students by working towards self-determination in our communities. Students develop a sense of identity, leadership and community. As an organization, we recognize our role as the official voice of all raza students on campus, and, taking this into account, our purpose is to advocate on behalf of raza students needs as well as offer our support. MEChA’s goal is to create a unity amongst students on campus and to make sure they are aware that they have a familia away from home without forgetting how community conditions have historically affected us. We aim to increase retention through our Calmecac mentoring program, increase educational access through Xinachtli, and raise consciousness of community issues with our Raza Youth Empowerment Program.","Other Categories":"Political, Cultural","Phone Number":"(323) 427-7926","Email":"mechadeucla@gmail.com","Website":"mechadeucla.com","Signatory 1":"Vivyana Prado","Signatory 2":"Eduardo Velasquez","Signatory 3":"Brian Luna","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Political","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Political"}

We hope to establish disciples of Christ by laying a foundation of devotion to Christ and building Christlike character. Devotion to Christ as expressed by an enjoyment of the Word of God, a zeal for prayer, and a love for the family of Christ are essentials to establish in a disciple’s life. These are necessary for transforming a disciple’s character to be more Christlike.\nEquip: God commands us all to go and make disciples! We equip brothers and sisters to make new disciples themselves by teaching them how to share the Gospel and how to establish and encourage others in the faith. By training committed disciples and challenging their faith, we hope to develop them into disciplemakers, and perhaps even makers of disciplemakers.","Other Categories":"Religious - Christian, Leadership","Phone Number":"408-219-4950","Email":"icabruins@gmail.com","Website":"http://www.tinyurl.com/bruinica","Signatory 1":"Adele Zhang","Signatory 2":"Jordan Ong","Signatory 3":"Claire Su","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Religious","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Religious"}

We hope to establish disciples of Christ by laying a foundation of devotion to Christ and building Christlike character. Devotion to Christ as expressed by an enjoyment of the Word of God, a zeal for prayer, and a love for the family of Christ are essentials to establish in a disciple’s life. These are necessary for transforming a disciple’s character to be more Christlike.\nEquip: God commands us all to go and make disciples! We equip brothers and sisters to make new disciples themselves by teaching them how to share the Gospel and how to establish and encourage others in the faith.

Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 120 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness.

Here, students can also pick up a variety of everyday items, including soap, toothpaste, menstrual products, pencils, notebooks, folders, and more. We provide free rentals of important resources, and currently offer umbrellas for 3 days at a time, formal clothing for a week at a time, and wheelchairs/crutches for 3 weeks at a time. One of our main goals is to be as sustainable as possible, and this is reflected not only in our practices, but also in the recycled and organic products we offer, as well as the hygiene refill station where students can refill their bottles with products such as body wash, laundry detergent, and lotion. Our center is also essentially a free thrift shop, reducing textile waste by hundreds of pounds annually. We receive the majority of our funding from the $0.33/quarter GCGP Basic Needs Referendum, passed in 2020, and we use this money to support the UCLA community.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5f1e48503401232bfadfe5d6"},"Organization Name":"Community College Field Biology Alliance","Category":"Service","Organization Description":"The Community College Field Biology Alliance will provide community college students from underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math  (STEM) the opportunity to experience scientific field work prior to transferring to a four-year university. Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field. \n","Other Categories":"Service - Outreach, Academic","Phone Number":"(818) 941-6830","Email":"CCFBioAlliance@gmail.com","Website":"https://communitycollegefieldbiologyalliance.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Amanda  Robin ","Signatory 2":"Aneri Patel","Signatory 3":"Cynthia  Frausto","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Service","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Service"}

To do so, we conduct interviews across Southern California with the children and their families to highlight holistic aspects of their lives. In our discussion with the patients, we also wish to understand structural barriers in society that exacerbate their surgical conditions, such as insurance issues, bullying, housing insecurity, etc. Moreover, we hope to eradicate these issues through connecting them with the right resources and organizations, using the funds that we raise to do so. \n\nIn addition to working towards patient care on an individual basis, we increase awareness about socioeconomic and sociocultural disparities in the healthcare system. With our written pieces about legal reform, anecdotal instances of inequity, and research-based findings about healthcare, we call attention to an area that is often overlooked—the surgical and psychological health of marginalized children within domestic borders.

While we all carry different motivations with us, I believe that we are unified by the desire to influence with our work and contribute meaningfully in some way. As we continue to learn and move\nforward with our careers, we also seek to understand how to be able to use our\nskills to think creatively and critically so as to solve real-life problems.\n\nThe student organization aims to volunteer with a socially-oriented data science\nprogram/organization. Some socially-oriented data science fellowships, typically in\nconjunction with non-profits and local governments, are available. The group will\nconduct voluntary analytical projects on the data from the public sector such as\nroad accidents, public hospitals, public policy efficiency and etc. The aim of these\nprojects will be to make an impact on the society with the help of data science.\nThis organization will solely focus on social good and offer various opportunities\nfor volunteering, whether it’s through mentoring or using data science skills to help\nsolve a social problem. The group will try to coordinate with many non-profits, host\ncompetitions and hackathons along the same vein.\n\nThe organization will consider solutions to real-world problems that we encounter on a daily basis. While useful in framing and presenting problems, competitions aren’t completely necessary for problem solving. A resourceful data scientist can identify and work to solve social good problems on their own, with the data available to them.

This disease has devastating impacts on patients and their families, and thus, efforts should be taken to decrease its incidence among the population. A significant number of cancer cases can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle, as environmental factors play an influential role in mutating genes and activating cancerous cells. Considering the current concerns regarding this disease, our organization aims to increase awareness about different cancers and their prevention methods. By doing so, we hope to ultimately decrease the number of new cancer cases each year.\n1- Since drug and alcohol abuse, and obesity are linked to cancer, CPP conducts information sessions, activities and events to promote a healthy lifestyle—both at UCLA and at local highschools.\n2- As a prevention method for skin cancer, sun-safety sessions shall be conducted to emphasize the importance of sunscreen.\n3- General meetings shall host panels with physicians to increase cancer awareness.\n4- Cancer-related careers shall be discussed in general meetings, in multiple fields.\n5- General meetings can host cancer researchers to inform club members about the recent advances in cancer treatment and prevention\n6- Fundraiser events shall be organized to raise money for cancer research and treatment, collaborating with well-known charities.\n7- Most importantly, CPP aims to increase awareness about Human \nPapillomavirus (HPV) not only in the UCLA community but also in the greater Los Angeles area. \nThe Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a great concern of the medical society as it can develop into various health problems such as genital warts and different cancers. In fact, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among the general population. Fortunately, there are methods to prevent HPV such as becoming vaccinated, being screened, and practicing safer sexual relationships. Despite being a vulnerable target for HPV—the most common sexually transmitted infection—a significant number of college students are unaware of this disease and its prevention methods. We hope that by explaining the complications associated with HPV we can increase the rate of vaccination in our community and thus, decrease the prevalence of cervical cancer.","Other Categories":"Service - Community Involvement, Medical","Phone Number":"310-488-8260","Email":"uclacpp@gmail.com","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Golbarg  Rahimi","Signatory 2":"Rana Yakhshi Tafti","Signatory 3":"Mahdi Rafati","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Service","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Service"}

Although many organizations focus simply on the medical issues at hand, we wish to construct an empowering narrative around disability. To do so, we conduct interviews across Southern California with the children and their families to highlight holistic aspects of their lives. In our discussion with the patients, we also wish to understand structural barriers in society that exacerbate their surgical conditions, such as insurance issues, bullying, housing insecurity, etc. Moreover, we hope to eradicate these issues through connecting them with the right resources and organizations, using the funds that we raise to do so. \n\nIn addition to working towards patient care on an individual basis, we increase awareness about socioeconomic and sociocultural disparities in the healthcare system. With our written pieces about legal reform, anecdotal instances of inequity, and research-based findings about healthcare, we call attention to an area that is often overlooked—the surgical and psychological health of marginalized children within domestic borders. Through “speaking out” on these issues, we aim to encourage a culture where advocating for community needs leads to healthcare equity.","Other Categories":"Service - Community Involvement, Medical","Phone Number":"(630)854-4183","Email":"info.sos.ucla@gmail.com","Website":"https://www.speakoutforsurgery.org","Signatory 1":"Isita Tripathi","Signatory 2":"Hannah Pham","Signatory 3":"Neha Joshi","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Service - Community Involvement","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Service%20-%20Community%20Involvement"}

In regards to fundraising, the organization will collaborate with the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation to participate in Foundation-affiliated fundraising events like Take Steps and spin4 crohn’s & colitis cures, as well as develop UCLA-focused events. Educational workshops will be conducted independently through various club events, collaboration with other pre-health and/or chronic illness student organizations, and in conjunction with the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. By uniting people who are connected to IBD, we will develop a strong network of social support and provide a safe space to discuss the psychosocial components of IBD.

This disease has devastating impacts on patients and their families, and thus, efforts should be taken to decrease its incidence among the population. A significant number of cancer cases can be prevented with a healthy lifestyle, as environmental factors play an influential role in mutating genes and activating cancerous cells. Considering the current concerns regarding this disease, our organization aims to increase awareness about different cancers and their prevention methods. By doing so, we hope to ultimately decrease the number of new cancer cases each year.\n1- Since drug and alcohol abuse, and obesity are linked to cancer, CPP conducts information sessions, activities and events to promote a healthy lifestyle—both at UCLA and at local highschools.\n2- As a prevention method for skin cancer, sun-safety sessions shall be conducted to emphasize the importance of sunscreen.\n3- General meetings shall host panels with physicians to increase cancer awareness.\n4- Cancer-related careers shall be discussed in general meetings, in multiple fields.\n5- General meetings can host cancer researchers to inform club members about the recent advances in cancer treatment and prevention\n6- Fundraiser events shall be organized to raise money for cancer research and treatment, collaborating with well-known charities.\n7- Most importantly, CPP aims to increase awareness about Human \nPapillomavirus (HPV) not only in the UCLA community but also in the greater Los Angeles area. \nThe Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a great concern of the medical society as it can develop into various health problems such as genital warts and different cancers. In fact, HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer among the general population. Fortunately, there are methods to prevent HPV such as becoming vaccinated, being screened, and practicing safer sexual relationships.

Students serve as research associates and work alongside neurologists during code strokes. Responsibilities include collecting information relating to the patient’s medical history and neurological deficits in order to identify potential candidates for enrollment in clinical trials that aim to find novel treatments for stroke. Students also serve as speakers who reach out to various communities. To date, more than 120 students have participated in the program, delivering over 300 lectures to over 7000 individuals. Formal testing has demonstrated that these presentations are highly effective, resulting in a significant increase in post-education stroke awareness. Through integrating experiences from clinical exposure in the Ronald Reagan Emergency Department, neurological rounds, health fairs, and presentations, this sect of the Stroke Program strives to provide a force to minimize response time and to facilitate treatment.","Other Categories":"Medical, Service - Outreach","Phone Number":"(951) 567-3479","Email":"strokeforce@gmail.com","Website":"https://www.strokeprogram.org/","Signatory 1":"Nathan Sanchez","Signatory 2":"Ikaasa Suri","Signatory 3":"Jakob Morgenland","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Service - Outreach","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Service%20-%20Outreach"}

Students will be mentored by graduate students from UCLA’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through all stages of an independent scientific project; from development of methods, to data collection on the UC James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve one of the 39 field sites apart of the University of California Natural Reserve System, to the write up of a scientific poster. Further, it is our goal to foster meaningful relationships between the student interns and the graduate student mentors that will last beyond just completion of their project. This will be accomplished through weekly and monthly meetings and community oriented social events. Lastly, during the duration of the program students will also be exposed to workshops and information sessions aimed at assisting in the transferring process and building tangible knowledge of scientific methods that can be applied in their future undergraduate research and graduate studies. Our program structure is as follows: (1) Community College students interested in the natural sciences and conducting scientific research in the field will be invited to apply to this program. The program will run from April to August, culminating in a 10 day trip to the field to collect data and the completion of a poster in time for the UCLA Summer Poster Symposium. (2) Students will be paired with UCLA graduate students in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department whose field research interests most closely align with their own. Students will meet virtually with their mentors weekly and in person monthly. Students and their mentors will develop an independent observational field project that could feasibly be completed with ten days of data collection during the summer. (3)By the beginning of July, students will have completed a literature review and a methods protocol for their proposed field project. In late July, students and graduate mentors will travel to the James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve. This reserve is located approximately 2 hours from UCLA in the San Bernardino National Forest and is a part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. Travel, food, and lodging will be included for all participants. (4) While in the field participants will be assisted by their graduate student mentors in collecting and analyzing data for their proposed project. Before returning home each student will have a completed scientific poster. (5) Aside from enacting their proposed research, students will attend skill-building workshops focused on cultivating tangible scientific and fieldwork skills that can be used throughout their careers. For example, interns will be introduced to ‘R’ Statistical software for data analysis and taught how to use species identification guides in the field. \n","Other Categories":"Service - Outreach, Academic","Phone Number":"(818) 941-6830","Email":"CCFBioAlliance@gmail.com","Website":"https://communitycollegefieldbiologyalliance.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Amanda  Robin ","Signatory 2":"Aneri Patel","Signatory 3":"Cynthia  Frausto","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Service - Outreach","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Service%20-%20Outreach"}

We assist students with the facilitation of resources, and advocate for our growing community which is fostered by non-traditional students, advocates and amazing faculty.\n \nOur  Mission:\nAs the Non-Traditional Student Network is to function as both a social, academic, and instituational support system for the diverse and growing demographic of non-traditional students at UCLA.\n\nWhat is a non-traditional student?\n-Anyone returning to school after taking a break from their educational goals. \n-Working professionals finishing a degree or working on a new one. \n-Parents returning to school after starting a family.\n-People returning from military service.\n-Older students returning to school after taking time of to pursue other life goals\n-Transfer students\n-Part-time students\n-Commuter students\n-Married students\n-Students who work full-time while enrolled and are financially independent \n-And more! \n\nThe 'non-traditional student' experience, and identity, falls outside of a traditional high school-to-college path. Despite the size and prevalence of the non-traditional student community most college systems are geared toward the traditional student. One glaring example of this is that non-traditional students now constitute about 40% of college students nationally and about 30% of UCLA's population, yet, there is no system in place to ensure effective communication between the college and the large non-traditional student base, there is no official transfer center on the UCLA campus, no place for students in this position to gather or go for support and amenity. \n\nThe Network at UCLA takes a more deliberate approach in bringing all students into the Bruin family, supporting and advocating specifically for those who took a 'non-traditional' path to get here.","Other Categories":"Transfer Students, Social","Phone Number":"(310)418-7114","Email":"UCLAnontrads@gmail.com","Website":"https://uclantsn.wixsite.com/ntsn","Signatory 1":"Abraham Flores","Signatory 2":"Abraham  Urias","Signatory 3":"Scarly  Guardado","Advisor Name":"KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo","Original Category":"Social","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Social"}

Essentially we consistently think of fun communal events, promote them, and put them on for people to enjoy.\n\nAt UCLA, there are many specific clubs and organizations which only cater to specific groups. With Pangea, we hope to relax the borders between these groups, and instead create bridges to enhance cultural perspective and appreciation. We think the richness in life comes from listening and understanding views other than our own and through our events, look to curate space to engage with them.

The sorority supports and provides a safe space for people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and diverse backgrounds. It emphasizes emotional support, personal development,\nunconditional acceptance.\n\nFounded in Spring of 2009, Gamma Rho Lambda has expanded into the first LGBT sorority on campus. In Spring 2010 GRL officially affiliated with UCLA's Multi-Interest Greek Council and became Zeta Chapter.\n\nSome examples of Gamma Rho Lambda's events are: game night, home-cooked dinners, Women's Day, socials, sister dates, as well as an end of the year banquet. We've volunteered at AIDS Walk and Vote for Equality and marched at LA pride and Long Beach Pride. We've fundraised by selling bracelets, rainbow cupcakes, and other baked goods.\n\nGamma Rho Lambda is much smaller than most typical sororities, but we pride ourselves in this fact. Our intimate size allows us to get to know every member and grow together as a community. Our biggest priority is to create a second home for our members, so that every member feels they have a family at UCLA. We provide an opportunity for growth and diversity. In addition, Gamma Rho Lambda aims to provide a safe, accepting, and supportive space for queer members who may not be out to their families.\n\nOn a national level, Gamma Rho Lambda currently has 14 chapters across the country and 1 colony. Our chapters are at Arizona State University, San Diego State University, CSU Northridge, UCLA, Purdue, SUNY- Albany, Northern Arizona University, University of Houston, UC Berkley, and UC Riverside, Ball State,Tulane, Iowa State, and American University. We also have a colony at University of Iowa. Each year we have a summer convention where representatives from all the chapters and colonies come and meet their fellow siblings. This weekend is not only a bonding experience, but an experience to share what every chapter has accomplished while spreading both ideas and concerns to each other and our National Council.\n\nPlease feel free to email us at zeta@gammarholambda.org if you have any questions or visit our website at grlzeta.wordpress.com to see what upcoming Rush or Sorority events we have planned!","Other Categories":"Greek Life - Sororities, Social Activism","Phone Number":"(707) 951-5070","Email":"zeta@gammarholambda.org","Website":"http://www.gammarholambda.org/zeta","Signatory 1":"Emily Earnest","Signatory 2":"Wren Crapser","Signatory 3":"Dana Dixon","Advisor Name":"LAWRENCE Daves","Original Category":"Social Activism","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Social%20Activism"}

DM seeks to empower the UCLA campus community in the fight against pediatric AIDS, raising funds and awareness about the importance of HIV education and testing, while helping young people make a difference in halting the spread of this devastating pandemic. \n\nNow entering its 18th year, DM has grown to be the largest student-run philanthropic event that raises funds and awareness for HIV/AIDS. However, DM is only a part of our larger, umbrella organization: the Pediatric AIDS Coalition (PAC). Now, not only will the students involved with PAC put on and participate in DM, but they will also participate in other events in an attempt to involve more of the community; people that may be inclined to fight for the cause but may not necessarily be interested in a DM.\n\nDance Marathon has raised over $5.5 million in the past 16 years, benefiting HIV-positive children around the world. Proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, “the largest Pediatric AIDS foundation in the United States“, the Laurel Foundation which is a free summer camp program that provide HIV-affected children with the experience of a lifetime, and the UCLA AIDS Institute, a cutting-edge research facility at the forefront of the search for a cure. Dance Marathon 2019 will be in the historic PAULEY PAVILION in April 2019!\n\nPAC also sponsors activities on campus throughout the year for the UCLA community including AIDS education in the form of performances and presentations, mentor days with kids from the camps, free HIV testing, and coordination of major events for World AIDS Day at UCLA. New programs include the Life Skills Retreat and a Family Mentorship Program. PAC is constantly looking for new, innovative ways to unite students, community activists, celebrities and leaders around the cause of pediatric AIDS treatment and eradication, and PAC is looking forward to its expansion into the greater Los Angeles community.\n\nDM has become a poster in the UCLA community, so much so that people commonly say that you can't graduate UCLA without having done DM at least once. People say that our generation is not empathetic, but DM proves them wrong. We unite 140 people as a committee and 3000+ in the community to join together to fight this cause.","Other Categories":"Social Activism, Educational","Phone Number":"(702) 403-0472","Email":"pac.president.ucla@gmail.com","Website":"https://pediatricaidscoalition.org/","Signatory 1":"Nina Enholm","Signatory 2":"Eleni Rally","Signatory 3":"Sophie  Ahmad","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Social Activism","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Social%20Activism"}

While we all carry different motivations with us, I believe that we are unified by the desire to influence with our work and contribute meaningfully in some way. As we continue to learn and move\nforward with our careers, we also seek to understand how to be able to use our\nskills to think creatively and critically so as to solve real-life problems.\n\nThe student organization aims to volunteer with a socially-oriented data science\nprogram/organization. Some socially-oriented data science fellowships, typically in\nconjunction with non-profits and local governments, are available. The group will\nconduct voluntary analytical projects on the data from the public sector such as\nroad accidents, public hospitals, public policy efficiency and etc. The aim of these\nprojects will be to make an impact on the society with the help of data science.\nThis organization will solely focus on social good and offer various opportunities\nfor volunteering, whether it’s through mentoring or using data science skills to help\nsolve a social problem. The group will try to coordinate with many non-profits, host\ncompetitions and hackathons along the same vein.\n\nThe organization will consider solutions to real-world problems that we encounter on a daily basis. While useful in framing and presenting problems, competitions aren’t completely necessary for problem solving. A resourceful data scientist can identify and work to solve social good problems on their own, with the data available to them.

After deciding that a disclaimer is no longer enough, we decided to address the issues presented by Vagina Monologues. This is a play by UCLA students, for UCLA students, filled with important rhetoric and stories that focuses on being more inclusive and based in intersectional feminist ideology.","Other Categories":"Arts, Social Activism","Phone Number":"(510) 463-7194","Email":"vdaycoalitionucla@gmail.com","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Erin Earp","Signatory 2":"Zainab Khan","Signatory 3":"Yafei (Daisy) Zheng","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Social Activism","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Social%20Activism"}

Boasting a combined on-campus and online presence of 1400+ members strong, the UCLA League of Legends community is ever growing and taking strides to raise the League of Legends presence through esports representation. Through weekly meetings, quarterly tournaments, and social gatherings, the UCLA League of Legends Club aims to create lasting friendships among their members and, through playing League of Legends, to instill in members the importance of team dynamics: cooperation, good communication, and sportsmanship. Though the UCLA League of Legends Club has gone through heavy changes since their beginnings as a Facebook interest group, their purpose has never strayed: to create an inclusive, safe environment where students that play League of Legends can come together to discuss, learn, and play the game, whilst always furthering the potential of e-sports as a whole.","Other Categories":"Social, Sports","Phone Number":"000-000-0000","Email":"uclalolclub@gmail.com","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Lawrence Wan","Signatory 2":"Alex Nguyen","Signatory 3":"Henry Guo","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Sports","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Sports"}

Specifically, our team of UCLA students designs, manufactures, and tests custom drones for accomplishing a series of mission objectives, as outlined by the AUVSI SUAS competition rules for the current season. This competition is held annually at the end of the school year in Maryland, where over 60 teams (half of which are international) compete for the best mission performance, technical design paper, and flight readiness presentation.\nUAS@UCLA complements the undergraduate engineering education at UCLA by offering the chance to gain hands-on experience on a complex engineering project. This project requires members to not only think outside the box of their major, but also learn collaboration and management skills through experience. Ultimately, UAS@UCLA is a big commitment, but the skills that are taught on the team directly apply to the professional environments you will experience in later jobs and internships.\nAs of 2018, UAS@UCLA has competed twice in the AUVSI competition, producing the two drones seen in the videos above. Our most recent drone, Spinny, is a 5ft diameter industrial-grade drone capable of 100lbs maximum lift and close to an hour of flight time at its base configuration. The current plan for this upcoming season is to use the existing flight vehicle hardware to mature the software framework running on board and on the ground to maximize mission performance and reliability of the platform. In addition, our team will begin the design process for our next drone -- a plane designed to build upon the legacy of Spinny and provide a new set of challenges for our team to address. Although the plane may turn into a two-year development, there will be lots of engineering questions to be answered by new members to ensure the success of this platform.\nFinally, UAS@UCLA is a family, and the connections you make on the team can not only serve to further your professional career, but also give you support during and beyond your time in the undergraduate programs offered at UCLA. One of the main goals of our 2018 - 2019 leadership team is to grow our club's culture and attract not only the best engineers to join our program, but also develop a diversified team with extensive collaboration opportunities among other teams at UCLA and internal career resources for leading members into their dream internship/job position in the STEM fields.","Other Categories":"Engineering, Technology","Phone Number":"(760)681-6528","Email":"unmannedsystems.ucla@gmail.com","Website":"uasatucla.org","Signatory 1":"David Thorne","Signatory 2":"Comran Morshed","Signatory 3":"Armaan Singh","Advisor Name":"ORLANDO Luna","Original Category":"Technology","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Technology"}

It has been and continues to be the goal of our program to help people with their taxes and educate them in the procedure of filing a return to help clarify the process and provide assistance to those who otherwise would go without aid. \n\nWe offer UCLA students:\n\n•  A great opportunity to give back to the community while getting hands-on experience\n•  Free training on individual income tax preparation\n•  Strong resume builder with tax experience and community service\n•  An opportunity to network with accounting firms \n•  IRS Certification","Other Categories":"Community Service, Business","Phone Number":"310-825-2333","Email":"vitaucla@gmail.com","Website":"vitaucla.org","Signatory 1":"Anthony Guan","Signatory 2":"Susan Chen","Signatory 3":"Saarah Khan","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Community Service","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Community%20Service"}

One foot at a time.\n\nWithout homes or any mode of transportation, hundreds of homeless people walk an average of 13 miles a day. Some walk for days, weeks, or months without having access to basic necessities such as clean water or properly fitted shoes. Many even refuse to air out their feet, conducive of many foot problems, afraid that their shoes might get stolen. As we, Happy Feet Clinic, provide those basic necessities and more, we are blessed with a powerfully humbling experience.\n\nAt shelters around Los Angeles, including the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A., the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica, the New Image Emergency Shelter in South LA, and PATH in Westwood, we treat hundreds of homeless people to a soothing foot wash in a tub of warm, soapy water. Next, we work side by side with podiatrists as they administer foot exams for the homeless community. Throughout the process, we interact with a variety of people in need of help and most importantly become aware of the large prominence of under-served communities and their critical need for assistance.\n\nFor many students, it is hard to grasp how prominent this population is in a thriving country as America. At first, students squirm at the thought of washing feet (especially those that may need much more care than our own). As soon as the event comes to an end however, many are instilled with the feeling to return again and again.\n\nThe power to help someone who has lost family, work, and shelter and put a smile on their face is an amazing feeling. This is what makes our organization unique.\n\nAny student with an interest in reaching out to under-served communities is invited to join.","Other Categories":"Community Service, Medical","Phone Number":"(949) 510-6183","Email":"happyfeetclinic@gmail.com","Website":"http://www.uclahappyfeetclinic.org/","Signatory 1":"Simran Brar","Signatory 2":"Darnell Bagsik","Signatory 3":"Jonathan Hwang","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Community Service","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Community%20Service"}

In the Los Angeles County, minorities make up the biggest portion of the population affected by depression, and many more remain undiagnosed due to cultural stigma. \n\nMental Health Initiative seeks to remove this stigma and offer support to at-risk populations through education, community service, and licensed provider referrals. Unlike other organizations that focus on campus events, we go directly to high schools, community colleges, libraries, nursing homes, and health fairs to educate the public about mental wellness. We provide workshops for members who seek to improve their own mental health. We also make connections with UCLA psychologists to extend counseling to underserved communities. In doing so, we aim to promote wellness throughout the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nMental health should not be second to physical health.

The students will take a diagnostic at the beginning and end of the year to monitor growth in specific concepts for each student and the group as a whole. Based upon these tests the curriculum for the program will be organized around the concepts of greatest struggle as highlighted by the diagnostic. \nThe first approach that LEAD will take will attempt to counter the present learning style in a typical math classroom, as it will encourage asking questions, working in groups, and a growth mindset. The program will attempt to execute the following three elements: basic skills, conceptual understanding and problem solving. LEAD will use real life application relevant to the students and by motivating students to work together and to think out loud, we hope to build leadership skills and development.\nThe second approach includes having activities and discussions that allow students to examine the intersections of race, class and math to get a greater understanding of the disparity of African American students in high level math classes and to combat the stigma of inadequacy.","Other Categories":"Educational, Community Service","Phone Number":"(424) 313-4860","Email":"lead@ucla.edu","Website":"https://leaducla.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Kailash Ram","Signatory 2":"Smriti Sanchita","Signatory 3":"Eshan Uniyal","Advisor Name":"ASHLEY Pham","Original Category":"Community Service","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Community%20Service"}

In addition to continuously providing a tutoring resource, Projecting Minds developed a second session in each site that provides interactive and diverse activities within science, art, and physical education that stimulates the service recipient’s extracurricular knowledge.

Upon assessing the needs of each facility, Afya works with US hospitals, corporations, and individuals to gather the supplies and ship them via sea cargo containers to these partners abroad. While our immediate goal is to improve the quality and availability of healthcare in undeserved areas, we also reduce the environmental impact in our own country by diverting \"waste\" from landfills and incineration to people in dire need. \n\nAfya at UCLA is an entirely student-run extension of this foundation.

Each box will contain high demand items such as toilet paper rolls, hand sanitizers, face masks, gloves, disinfectant wipes and sprays as well as non-perishable food such as pasta, rice, lentils, canned goods etc... \nAdditionally, my organization will do everything it can to support our healthcare system during these very difficult times. We will be reaching out to every private clinic (plastic surgeons, dermatologists etc...) and small manufactures to see whether we can help them donate their PPE to hospitals in the Los Angeles area (poor neighborhoods) that are in need of them. \nWe already donated $3,420 worth of hand sanitizer to the mlk hospital in Compton and intend on donating a lot more to many other hospitals that are in need. \nIn regards to the underprivileged division, we will be using the same concept of care packages and ship them to refugee camps across California. \nFinally, I’d love to be able to join hands with big corporate companies such as Target, Ralph’s, Trader Joe’s, UPS and many more so that we can come together as one in order to support the elderly, the disadvantaged and the healthcare system. \nI already got a lot of people on board and we are all extremely determined to help our community the best way we can during these extremely difficult times.

The NBLJ was started in 1970 by 5 African-American law students and 2 African-American law professors. The Journal was the first of its kind in the country. Because of the drop in African-American students at UCLA School of Law after the passage of proposition 209, the journal was sent to Columbia where publication could be continued.\nOne of the Journals founding editors noted that it was important that there be a forum for providing a theoretical framework for practical daily application of Black legal ideas and concepts. The Journal has aimed to build on this tradition by publishing articles that make a substantive contribution to current dialogue taking place around issues such as affirmative action, employment law, the criminal justice system, community development and labor issues. The Journal has a commitment to publish articles that inspire new thought, explore new alternatives and contribute to current jurisprudential stances.\nIn 2005, a group of students at UCLA began the process of bringing the journal back to its birthplace through the organization of a symposium entitled \"Regression Analysis: The Status of African Americans in American Legal Education.\" In the Fall of 2009, a group of committed students reformed the NBLJ Board and in Spring 2010, NBLJ published at UCLA for the first time in over a decade.","Other Categories":"Academic, African American","Phone Number":"949-600-3523","Email":"nblj@lawnet.ucla.edu","Website":"","Signatory 1":"Tierney Sharpe Dioffo","Signatory 2":"Zalondria Graham","Signatory 3":"Jaz Buckley","Advisor Name":"KRISTOPHER Kaupalolo","Original Category":"African American","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=African%20American"}

In spirituality we have Kirtan nights, set prayer times, meditation, Gurbani and Punjabi classes, and debates on the faith.  Additionally, our association provides the students of UCLA with the opportunity to engage in unique community service efforts such as Sikh Relief (who provide assistance by fighting the drug problem in Punjab, help Sikh Political Prisoners, provide relief in Nepal or anywhere else there is a natural disaster) as well as work with the United Sikh Movement to offer langar (free food) to individuals that lack these resources (i.e. Skid Row, Riverside, and other regions in LA).  Lastly, we make sure our members feel at home and enjoy the beautiful city of LA by hosting mixers, bonfires, beach trips, hikes, movie nights, ice skating and a range of other fun social activities. From day one, we hope to be efficient with our professional lives but at the same time enjoy our college years through Seva, Simran (prayer and mediation), and Kirt (working diligently).

UGSP is designed to provide valuable social support to these students whom may otherwise find it difficult to pursue their graduate studies. Through activities, mentorship, and community outreach, we hope to provide a community that encourages the potential and promise of those from underrepresented groups.  By promoting and improving multicultural training in psychology, we hope to not only increase ethnic minority student recruitment, retention, and graduation but also improve intergroup relations within our department. UGSP operates with the following branches:\n\nUGSP Brown Bag Committee\nThis committee organizes a lecture series that is open to all graduate students. These talks are given by faculty members and post-doctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds or whose research focuses on diversity issues. Each Brown Bag lecture includes both a research presentation and a career development component. This speaker series allows graduate students to network with prominent faculty members from underrepresented groups, hopefully fostering a sense social connectedness and community within the Psychology Department.\n\nUGSP Undergraduate Outreach Committee \nThis committee organizes panels for undergraduate students to learn about various aspects of the graduate student experience. We hope to galvanize interest in graduate school by offering examples of successful underrepresented students from their own university. We also hope that this will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to connect with graduate students so they feel comfortable asking questions about diversity in graduate school.\n\nUGSP High School Outreach Committee \nAs members of underrepresented groups, we find it imperative to give back to our communities through teaching, education, and service.  UGSP will target high schools in low-income neighborhoods and will hold lectures for both parents and students about getting into college.\n\nUGSP Social Committee \nThe Social Committee plans and coordinates various events each year, typically off campus. Our goal in organizing these events is to foster a sense of community among UGSP members. It is a chance for students to interact with people that come from diverse backgrounds who share similar experiences.","Other Categories":"Academic, Cultural/Ethnic","Phone Number":"(516)998-8215","Email":"ucla.ugsp@gmail.com","Website":"https://ugsp.psych.ucla.edu/","Signatory 1":"ReJoyce Green","Signatory 2":"Gerald Higginbotham","Signatory 3":"Blanche Wright","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Cultural/Ethnic","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Cultural/Ethnic"}

Living as college students in Los Angeles, we want to help students understand how influenced we all are by media images and we want to give students the tools to combat these influences. The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness. As students, we all face a variety of obstacles that can ultimately hold us back. We hope to reduce these personal barriers to help each student here reach their full potential.","Other Categories":"Health and Wellness, Fitness","Phone Number":"310-825-7586","Email":"bodyimagetaskforce.ucla@gmail.com","Website":"http://swc.ucla.edu/","Signatory 1":"Charlotte Chan","Signatory 2":"Helen Zhong","Signatory 3":"Lorena Palattao","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Fitness","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Fitness"}

The UCLA chapter was founded last year in 2016 and it focuses on promoting the long-term benefits of routine fitness and good nutrition. Our club’s main mission is to work on reducing the current widespread epidemic of chronic diseases, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, through prevention and educational programs. These two main programs are: 1) FitlifeFlow program and 2) Health Project. The FitlifeFlow program recruits undergraduate students to pledge to participate in a 5-week exercise program, exercising three days a week for thirty minutes each time. A few scientific research studies have been published describing the outcomes of these incentivized exercise programs, showing that there is a long-term success rate of increasing one’s overall commitment to routine exercise. The Health Project, the other program, will be an education-focused program, as we will travel to local schools and educate young students on the long-term health benefits of exercise and nutrition. We will aim to make these educational presentations fun and engaging, so that the kids are able to absorb some important facts in regards to health and nutrition. \n\nThe Health Guardians of America club will aim to educate the public, and especially at-risk youth, about the nationwide obesity epidemic that leads to chronic heart disease, diabetes, and other preventable diseases. Our goal is to empower the public on the steps they can take to reverse the development of these chronic diseases and to instead live a high quality life due to a healthy diet and routine exercise.","Other Categories":"Health and Wellness, Fitness","Phone Number":"(808) 497-3664","Email":"ucla@healthguardians.org","Website":"http://www.healthguardians.org","Signatory 1":"Natassia Dunn","Signatory 2":"Saichandra Kalvakota","Signatory 3":"Niveda Balemurughan","Advisor Name":"MICHAEL Gamez","Original Category":"Fitness","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Fitness"}

None, however, have to accomplish all of this in 2 years! Furthermore, we believe the relative lack of visibility of transfers has discouraged many from participating fully in campus life.

UVP has been assisting UMMA Clinic since it's inception and played a crucial role in the clinic's early success by providing a steady group of volunteers to assist at the clinic. UVP allows students the opportunity to volunteer at health fairs, giving them first-hand exposure to the health care field in one of the most underserved regions in the nation. Volunteers also help at the many events in which UMMA Clinic participates, including the Hawthorne Health Fair, Tax Day, Fremont Farmers Market, and Humanitarian Day. \n\nTo further address the needs of the community, UVP is committed to providing preventative health education to students and patients in South Los Angeles.\n\nUVP has established a weekly, after-school health and physical education course at both 68th Street Elementary School and ISLAH LA Academy with the aim of promoting healthy living. As part of this course, students are taught lessons on nutrition and the importance of healthy eating, as well as other health topics. Following each lesson plan are fun and interactive outdoor activities to get the students moving, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a lifelong enjoyment of physical activity.\n\nIn addition to the youth, UVP also aims to educate the adult population of South Los Angeles about various health disorders through the Preventative Health Initiative (PHI). Every week, UVP volunteers spread awareness of initial warning signs, disease prevention, and healthy life-style practices to the UMMA Clinic patients and local community members. These efforts are aimed to curb the prevalence of common health disorders including diabetes, hypertension, and other prevalent conditions.","Other Categories":"Health and Wellness, Medical","Phone Number":"310-825-0068","Email":"umma.clinic.vol@gmail.com","Website":"https://ummavp.weebly.com/","Signatory 1":"Zain Khalifeh","Signatory 2":"Zain Kashif","Signatory 3":"Mominah  Subhan ","Advisor Name":"JAKE Gildea","Original Category":"Health and Wellness","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Health%20and%20Wellness"}

Through unique programs and events, HNF focuses on bringing together all the elements of the triangle to provide students with a truly holistic approach to life.","Other Categories":"Health and Wellness, Fitness","Phone Number":"310-825-7586","Email":"swchnf@gmail.com","Website":"http://swc.ucla.edu/","Signatory 1":"Sara \t Khattab","Signatory 2":"Quinn Maloney","Signatory 3":"Charlotte Chan","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Health and Wellness","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Health%20and%20Wellness"}

The media has given us a specific image of what is beautiful, and we want to encourage every student on campus to feel confident and beautiful no matter how their body looks. By improving our self esteem, we can focus less time on our physical appearance and more time on living our lives. We hope to enhance the self esteem of students by demonstrating beauty isn’t only skin-deep, and by pushing students to be positive with themselves and not to be so critical. We also want to show how physical health affects mental health. We want to teach students ways to take care of their own health which will help them feel better. For instance we emphasize healthy eating and fitness, but encourage individuals to focus on feeling good rather than looking good. We want to make help accessible to those who are struggling with body dismorphia or eating disorders. Through our programming, we hope to educate the student body on these issues and how to tackle them. The Body Image Task Force also aims to help students learn how to handle college stress. We hope to provide stress outlets because we believe that mental health is also connected to self esteem and in general happiness.

The Health Project, the other program, will be an education-focused program, as we will travel to local schools and educate young students on the long-term health benefits of exercise and nutrition. We will aim to make these educational presentations fun and engaging, so that the kids are able to absorb some important facts in regards to health and nutrition. \n\nThe Health Guardians of America club will aim to educate the public, and especially at-risk youth, about the nationwide obesity epidemic that leads to chronic heart disease, diabetes, and other preventable diseases.

Through this organization, students will have the chance to live inside their stories and not feel pressured to live in the stories of others. We will provide workshops that not only encourage students to be vulnerable but also provide the essential knowledge to teach the importance of vulnerability to underserved populations in the Los Angeles County. By achieving this mission, we aim to instill the core belief that we are all “enough” and worthy of love.\n","Other Categories":"Self Improvement, Health and Wellness","Phone Number":"(626) 400-3816","Email":"daringbruins@gmail.com","Website":"","Signatory 1":"William Lan","Signatory 2":"Christian Campana","Signatory 3":"Amanda Vo","Advisor Name":"PAMELA Cysner","Original Category":"Health and Wellness","Link Scraped":"https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search?category=Health%20and%20Wellness"}

Each box will contain high demand items such as toilet paper rolls, hand sanitizers, face masks, gloves, disinfectant wipes and sprays as well as non-perishable food such as pasta, rice, lentils, canned goods etc... \nAdditionally, my organization will do everything it can to support our healthcare system during these very difficult times. We will be reaching out to every private clinic (plastic surgeons, dermatologists etc...) and small manufactures to see whether we can help them donate their PPE to hospitals in the Los Angeles area (poor neighborhoods) that are in need of them. \nWe already donated $3,420 worth of hand sanitizer to the mlk hospital in Compton and intend on donating a lot more to many other hospitals that are in need. \nIn regards to the underprivileged division, we will be using the same concept of care packages and ship them to refugee camps across California. \nFinally, I’d love to be able to join hands with big corporate companies such as Target, Ralph’s, Trader Joe’s, UPS and many more so that we can come together as one in order to support the elderly, the disadvantaged and the healthcare system. \nI already got a lot of people on board and we are all extremely determined to help our community the best way we can during these extremely difficult times.
